# Möbli Sneak Preview 1.0

Möbli is a cozy decorator game that combines handcrafted miniature furniture with the latest interior design trends. 
It is all about celebrating imperfections and having carefree fun, it is a space to relax and be creative without any expectations.

I'm making Möbli with GDevelop and it is the first game I am making, learning a lot along the way.
This version is a sneak preview that I am publishing so that I can share the project I am workin on with people who are interested.
It is a sandbox game, and at this point it is nothing more than a space where you can coordinate furniture, without any goals or limits.
More features of the game are planned for the future, such as design challenges, the ability to select different rooms as backdrops, and animated characters.


## How to Play

This game uses mouse and keyboard controls.

Click an object in the cataglogue on the right of the screen to plop it onto the work area.
Once generated in the work area, click and drag objects to move them around.
A yellow border shows the object your mouse hovers over, and which will be selected when you click.
A pink border means an object is selected.

Objecs can be recolored with the swatches on the left of the screen, 
but you must first select one of the dots above the swatches to select what material you want to recolor.

Q and E keys: rotate the selected object
X key: deletes the selected object
